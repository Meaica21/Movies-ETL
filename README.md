The purpose of the activity is to clean-up and convert a messy and almost unusable data into reliable and clean dataset which will be used during hackathon.
With the use of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, code refactoring, and PostgreSQL, combine Wikipedia and Kaggle, and follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
